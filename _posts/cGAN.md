Conditional GAN, could be conditioned on class label. The condition


Alternately, a GAN can be trained in such a way that both the generator and the discriminator models are conditioned on the class label. This means that when the trained generator model is used as a standalone model to generate images in the domain, images of a given type, or class label, can be generated.

Generative adversarial nets can be extended to a conditional model if both the generator and discriminator are conditioned on some extra information y. […] We can perform the conditioning by feeding y into the both the discriminator and generator as additional input layer.
